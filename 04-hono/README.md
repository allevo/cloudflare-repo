# 04 - hono

This is an example on how to use the `hono` library to create a worker that returns a JSON object with a message.
This example also proxies the request to a different URL.

- Run `npm run dev` in your terminal to start a development server
- Open a browser tab at http://localhost:8787/ to see your worker in action
- Run `npm run deploy` to publish your worker
