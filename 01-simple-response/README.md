# 01 - simple response

This is the first example of a Cloudflare Worker.
It's a simple "Hello World" worker that responds with a text response.

- Run `npm run dev` in your terminal to start a development server
- Open a browser tab at http://localhost:8787/ to see your worker in action
- Run `npm run deploy` to publish your worker
